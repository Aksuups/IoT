## Project for tracking motorhome gas tank levels using ESP32 microcontroller and HX711 Amp with load cells.

Additionally ESP32 utilizes BME280-sensor to track relative humidity and temperature inside the motorhome, and
TMP36-sensor to track outside temperature.
  
Values from load cells are amplified using HX711 amplifier connected to ESP32.  
~~Webserver is created locally inside ESP32.
ESP32 is connected to motorhome's internal network wirelessly.~~

 **Powering microcontroller and components**
    
    Microcontroller gets power from motorhomes 12V power supply with   
    Texas Instruments LM2596 Step-Down Voltage Regulator in between to   
    regulate voltage presicely. 12V is stepped down to 6-7V 1A to meet  
    power consumption demands, but to also reduce amount of heat dissipated  
    from the microcontroller.  
    
 **Two ways to access UI and display data**  
    
    1) Physical 3.5″ TFT LCD touch screen to display sensor data quickly when inside the motorhome.  
       
    2) Smartphone application with custom dashboard as UI to see data on the go.
       Project will consists the usage of Blynk application and API, to give easiest access 
       to the sensor data when not near the motorhome.
